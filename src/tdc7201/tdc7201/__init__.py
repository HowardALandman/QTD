""" Driver for the Texas Instruments tdc7201 time-to-digital converter chip.
    Web page: http://www.ti.com/product/tdc7201

    This code assumes that you are working with the TDC7201-ZAX-EVM
    evaluation board. For the most part, things won't change for the raw chip,

    This code requires SPI to talk to the chip and set control registers
    and read result registers. SPI must be turned on at the kernel level.
    You can do this in Preferences -> Raspberry Pi Configuration ->
    Interfaces in the GUI, or using raspi-config from the command line;
    it will require a reboot. If it is on, there should be an uncommented
    line like "dtparam=spi=on" in /boot/config.txt.

    Written and tested on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Raspberry Pi Zero W,
    but should work on any model with a 2x20 pin header..

        """Initialize all the non-SPI GPIO pins.

           +3.3V and *both* GND pins need to be hardwired, and SPI
           signals need to be handled by spidev, but all other used
           signals must be assigned to a GPIO pin.
           The assignments are arbitrary but must match hardware wiring.
           The defaults use only GPIO with no "alternate function",
           for maximum flexibility.

           SPI pins are owned by spidev and must NOT be set using GPIO lib.
           NOTE that chip CS1 and CS2 are wired to Pi CE0 and CE1 respectively!
           Don't get confused and think that Pi CE1 drives chip CS1! It doesn't!
           DOUT2 = MISO2 can be shorted to DOUT1 = MISO1, as long as
           CS1 and CS2 are *NEVER* both asserted low at the same time
           but I'm not sure what spidev does about that, so leave it separate.
           The EVM brings it out separately.
           Note that we CANNOT read side #2 of the chip in this configuration.
           Don't need DOUT2 if only using side #1, but assign for completenes.

           ENABLE high turns chip on, ENABLE low forces complete reset.

           OSC_ENABLE high turns on the EVM's clock generator chip (marked Y1).
           It is a board function, not a chip function.
           If OSC_ENABLE is low,
           then you must supply an external clock, connected to the board's
           EXT_CLOCK pin.
           (I think. I haven't tested this.)

           The TRIGx signal indicates that the converter is ready to start.
           Typically you would either use it to directly trigger some hardware,
           or wait for it in your processor before sending out your own trigger.
           We assume the latter here, so assign a pin to it.
           Note that measurement does not start until converter gets the START signal.

           The INTx signal going low indicates that measurement has stopped.
           This can be because of success, or timeout; you need to read INT_STATUS
           to determine which.

           TRIG1 and INT1 only need to be set if you are using the #1 side of chip.
           TRIG2 and INT2 only need to be set if you are using the #2 side of chip.

           The START signal may be supplied externally to each side,
           separately through START_EXT1 and START_EXT2 SMA connectors,
           or together through the COMMON_START SMA connector.
           If you want to drive one of these from the RPi, then the
           MSP_START signal needs to be wired up to TP10, a PCB mount SMA connector
           needs to be soldered into the EVM board at TP10, you need to put
           a cable from TP10 to one of the START SMA connectors mentioned above,
           and the GPIO needs to be declared.

           The STOP signals on the EVM board come in through SMA connectors,
           and therefore do not have pins on the header.
           The STOP pin is only used for simulating data.
           If you want to use that feature, then the STOP output pin on the RPi
           needs to be wired to an SMA conector,
           and that connector cabled to the appropriate SMA connector on the EVM.

           Unused signals may be set to None to save a pin.
