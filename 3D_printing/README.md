# 3D Printing
Some parts of the experimental equipment will be 3D printed.
This directory holds the relevant files, but the original source may be elsewhere.

## Plate support (25 mm)
### A first experiment, just a stand for a 10 cm plate

Print data: plate_support_35_mm.stl
Mass (HIPS): 15 grams

## Detector slot
### A piece of the detector frame, intended to support one edge of a plate
### Not useful in itself, just for checking printing tolerances.

## Detector side
### One side of detector structural prototype.
### Four of these together (with a couple of cable ties) make a complete frame.

## Tolerance vernier
### A simple test piece for printing tolerances.
### Various nominal size tabs and slots in 0.1 mm increments.
### Print two of these and try to fit them together.

## Sphere support
### Designed to fit over the column head of my Van De Graff Generator
### and provide a support ring for the botton of the sphere
### (which will be in hemispheres and cannot be suspended from the top
### like a single sphere.)
